## ‚ùì Huh? 
Here's a general overview of application into our serverless bootcamp.
1. Complete this [information form](https://jkfr7wbzytt.typeform.com/serverless-camp), so we can contact you if you get accepted :)
2. Use this repository to complete the required coding portion!

## üåü General Tips
- Each problem is formatted as an issue in GitHub. 
- Read each issue COMPLETELY
- Create a new branch to write your code
- Create a pull request to merge the branch you're working on onto `main`
- Only merge the pull request when the bot approves your changes
- If the bot says something went wrong, you can edit your code and commit again!

## üòÄ How to use this repository
[Watch our loom video](https://www.loom.com/share/7edcdb4f60a443ebbad80d2e7b962deb) for steps on how to get started with this repo!

<!-- 1. Click the green button in the upper-right corner with the text `Use this template`
2. Name your repository something interesting, such as `bitprj-is-the-best`
3. Wait for about 20 seconds for the repository to be created
4. Click into the `Issues` tab
5. Click `New issue`
6. Choose the `üöÄ Start Course` issue, and click `Get started`
7. Click `Submit new issue`
8. Click on the `Issues` tab again to refresh the page
9. Click into the first issue, and get started :) -->

## üìù Once the first issue is created...
1. Read the instructions COMPLETELY
2. Complete steps listed in the instructions
3. Commit your code to the branch specified in the instructions
4. Create a pull request to merge the branch you are working on onto `main` (FIRST STEP ONLY: [draft the pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request), then mark it as ready for review)
5. If the bot approves your pull request, then **merge the pull request**
6. If the bot does not approve your changes, look at what the bot comments, and **fix your code accordingly**


## Approve or not?

**‚ÄºÔ∏è Bot not approving pull request**

When this happens, don't worry! Try to debug your code and commit the code again to the branch you are working on (not `main`), when you are ready for the bot to check your code again. 

> ‚ùå When the bot does NOT approve your pull request, do NOT merge the pull request
